Kernel Porting Documentation
============================

Introduction:
------------

This exercise involves creating a new hypothetical board same as the the mini2440
board and porting the linux kernel to it. It is intended to learn about kernel porting.

Board description:
-----------------
Board is same as the mini2440 board with the S3C2440 processor. I am creating a new
board(a machine type) called MINI2440_REWORK. This is a hypothetical board with the
same mini2440 configuration. Later there might be plans to rework the board to test
the port.

Porting experience:
------------------
Initial step is to create defconfig with minimal definitions needed to boot.

Next trying my hand on creating a MACHINE_START, MACHINE_END. Got an error saying 
-> error: ‘MACH_TYPE_MINI2440_REWORK’ undeclared here (not in a function)
To fix the error we have to create this machine type in arch/arm/tools/mach-types.

machine_is_xxx->mini2440_rework	
CONFIG_xxx -> MACH_MINI2440_REWORK 
MACH_TYPE_xxx -> MINI2440_REWORK	
number -> 4173

*Note*: that we need to register a MACHINE_ID in arm linux website to get an ID.

Cannot progress further with the new machine type as this requires bootloader
modification. This is deferred right now as it being dangerous.

To circumvent this, use the same MACHINE_ID but move the files relevant to
mini2440 and write my own files. All files replacing it will have rework suffix.

----------
Created various dummy functions for mapping io, setting irq and time_init.
Understanding of the flow is easier if read from the caller list [TODO: Update the function and file]

Encountered calculating DELAY loops which calculates the time taken for a loop. It will used in
udelay or mdelay. Or the jiffies would be used.[TODO: Update the exact function].
